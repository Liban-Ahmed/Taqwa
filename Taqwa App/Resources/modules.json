          "text": "Islam is built on five pillars that act as the foundational acts of worship. They are:\n\n1. Shahada (Declaration of Faith): Bearing witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad (ﷺ) is His messenger.\n2. Salah (Prayer): Observing the five daily prayers at their prescribed times. The Quran states, 'Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times' (Qur’an 4:103).\n3. Zakat (Charity): Giving a fixed portion of one’s wealth to the needy. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Charity does not decrease wealth' (Muslim).\n4. Sawm (Fasting): Abstaining from food, drink, and marital relations from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan.\n5. Hajj (Pilgrimage): Performing the pilgrimage to Makkah at least once in a lifetime if one is able.\n\nThese pillars shape a Muslim’s daily life and spiritual connection with Allah. They are not merely rituals but expressions of faith, discipline, and compassion for humanity.",

Belief in the revealed books: Such as the Torah, the Gospel, and especially the Quran, Allah’s final revelation.\n4. Belief in the prophets: From Adam to Muhammad (ﷺ), they conveyed Allah’s guidance.\n5. Belief in the Day of Judgment: All of mankind will be held accountable for their deeds.\n6. Belief in Qadr (Divine Decree): Everything happens by Allah’s will and wisdom.\n\nThe Quran says, 'The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so have the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers…' (Qur’an 2:285). Understanding these articles fosters a strong, coherent worldview and provides moral guidance.",
